# Create a GitHub Action

Read [Creating an action](../../../docs/creating-an-action.md) and the action-registration section
of [CI and releases](../../../docs/ci-and-releases.md#registering-an-action-for-releases). Check
`git status --short` and make sure the requested folder does not already exist under `actions/`.

Generate the action from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm gen:action --args <folder> "<Display Name>" "<description>"
```

Use a kebab-case folder name. The generator creates a Node 24 JavaScript action in
`actions/<folder>/`, including `action.yml`, a runnable `src/index.mjs`, co-located tests, the
per-action `src/utils.mjs` input/output helpers and their regression tests. It also registers the
action for Release Please and adds its row to the root README. Do not hand-write those registrations
or edit generated release files.

Implement the requested behavior in `src/index.mjs`. Read GitHub inputs with
`getInput('input-name')` from `src/utils.mjs`, passing each input's declared name with its hyphens.
GitHub exposes `plugin-name` as `INPUT_PLUGIN-NAME`; replacing hyphens with underscores makes the
input appear empty. Keep behavior tests beside the implementation in `src/*.test.mjs`, including
hyphenated environment keys for actions with hyphenated inputs.

Document usage and behavior in the action README. Its Inputs and Outputs tables are generated from
`action.yml`; update those descriptions and declarations there, then run `pnpm readme`. Do not edit
the generated tables directly. Read values with `getInput()` and write declared outputs with
`setOutput()` from `src/utils.mjs`; keep their scaffold regression tests. JavaScript actions run on
GitHub's Node 24 runtime, so consumers do not need `actions/setup-node` for the action. Use a
composite action only when the implementation needs to orchestrate workflow steps. Nested action
metadata in this monorepo is usable by path, but is not automatically listed in GitHub Marketplace.

After implementation, run the action's tests and `node .agents/hooks/check.mjs` with the changed
files. Inspect the generated release entries and README table, and review the final diff. Commit and
push only when the user explicitly asks.
